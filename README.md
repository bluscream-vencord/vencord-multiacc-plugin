## Account Setup

### Getting Discord Tokens

⚠️ **Warning**: Extracting Discord tokens is against Discord's Terms of Service and may result in account termination.

To get tokens (for educational purposes only):

1. Open Discord in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Look for requests to `discord.com/api`
5. Find the `authorization` header value

### Adding Accounts

1. Open plugin settings
2. Click "Manage Accounts"
3. Enter your Discord token
4. The plugin will attempt to validate and add the account

## Technical Details

### Architecture

-   **Account Management**: Stores account data locally
-   **UI Merging**: Patches Discord's store functions to return merged data
-   **Token Handling**: Securely stores and manages multiple tokens
-   **State Management**: Tracks active accounts and their data

### Limitations

-   **Token Security**: Tokens are stored locally (consider security implications)
-   **API Rate Limits**: Multiple accounts may hit rate limits faster
-   **Discord TOS**: May violate Discord's Terms of Service
-   **Experimental**: Plugin is in early development stage

## Security Considerations

-   **Token Storage**: Tokens are stored in plain text locally
-   **Account Safety**: Using multiple accounts may trigger Discord's security systems
-   **Data Privacy**: All account data is processed locally

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plugin not loading**: Ensure Vencord is properly installed
2. **Accounts not merging**: Check that accounts are marked as active
3. **Token errors**: Verify tokens are valid and not expired
4. **UI not updating**: Try reloading Discord
